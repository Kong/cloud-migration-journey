# Kong Migration Journey: Phase 3

The `make kong.phase3` step created a Kong Mesh `Cloud Zone` using the Kuberentes Mode deployment strategy, deployed the disputes microservice and configured the namespace to auto instantiate dataplanes for any pods.

## Objective

The `objective` of Phase 3 is to further our understanding of Multi-Zone cross platform features of Kong Mesh and how it can be leveraged to maintain connectivity on-premise and cloud ecosystems.

The high level `activities` that will take place in this phase are:

* Review the Cloud Zone Setup of Kong Mesh.

* Review the Dataplane (Sidecar Proxy) of the Disputes Microservice deployed in cloud.

* Apply the mesh traffic policy that will re-direct disputes to the microservice.

At the end of phase 3 you should be `comfortable` with the following:

* Kuberentes Setup of a Zone and microservices.

* Multi-zone behavior of Kong Mesh.

## Architecture

</p>

In phase 3, the Amazon EKS cluster was integrated as a cloud zone into the mesh, and the diputes microservice was onboarded. Let's look through the GUI.

**Global Control Plane GUI**

The GUI is available on: `http://<Global CP IP>:5681/gui`. &#8594;

`Zone CPs`

Navigate to the Zone CPs in the left-handle panel.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../img/phase_3/2_zones.png" width="1400" /></div>
</p>

Some good information here. We can see the zone names, are they healthy with the status, are ingress and egress enabled in each of those zones.

We should also point out the `Backend Type`, the type `Kuberentes` is straight-forward, but the type `Memory` we should take a sec to talk about. With `Univeral deployments`, there are two supported backend types `Memory` and `Postgres`. It is not best practice to use type `Memory` restarting the kuma-cp process will delete all the data and you cannot have more than one zone cp instance running at time. So this is really a big slap on the wrist.

`Dataplanes`

<p align="center">
    <img src="../img/phase_3/3_dps.png" width="1400" /></div>
</p>

Just quickly, we should highlight a couple of things regarding the kubernetes based dps. Each microservice pod backed by the mesh is a dataplane. So here we can see there is 1 dp in the cloud zone, i.e 1 pod being supported. Second, many of the tags defined on the dp are autogenerated by the the mesh services, but not all. For example, to support canary deployments usually a version tag is added as well to support that logic, that need to be added as a label Kuberentes Deployment Manifest of the Microservice.

## Activities - With Mesh, Re-direct Disputes Traffic to Cloud Microservice

Ok Finally, last step. Let's actually re-direct the traffic.

SSH into the `Global Control Plane`:

```console
ssh -i ~/.kmj/ec2/ec2.key ubuntu@35.85.31.178
```

Navigate to the `/home/kuma`:

```console
cd /home/kuma
```

Let's apply the first policy:

```console
mesh/kong-mesh-1.8.1/bin/kumactl apply -f mesh-policies/phase3/1-kong-reroute.yaml
```

Navigate to the Mesh GUI, in the left-hand panel scroll down to `Traffic Routes`, and you should see a new route, `kong-reroute`.

When we read the resource below it says. When traffic from the source `kong` is intended for the service `monolith`, if there is a url match `/monolith/resources/card/dispute` direct that traffic to the `microservice`.

```yaml
type: TrafficRoute
name: kong-reroute
mesh: default
sources:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: kong
destinations:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: monolith-service_svc_5000
conf:
  http:
    - match:
        path:
          prefix: "/monolith/resources/card/dispute"
      destination:
        kuma.io/service: microservice_microservice_svc_8080
  destination:
    kuma.io/service: monolith-service_svc_5000
```

Now that the policy is applied, lets validate with `Insomnia`.

Open the `Migration Journey Collection` &#8594; Open the `Phase 2 and 3 - Mesh` sub-folder &#8594; Execute the Disputes Request.

We recieved a `404`, hmm doesn't seem right what happened? Oh the new disputes microservice doesn't have a rest endpoint  `/monolith/resources/card/dispute`. The new dispute actually exposes an endpoint `/disputes`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="../img/phase_3/4_insomnia_1.png" /></div>
</p>

Let's go back to the Global Control Plane and fix this. Apply the updated policy `2-kong-reroute.yaml`

```console
mesh/kong-mesh-1.8.1/bin/kumactl apply -f mesh-policies/phase3/2-kong-reroute.yaml
```

When the updated kong-reroute policy now reads - when a request hits the `kong` service (the runtime instance), and is intended for the `monolith`, if there is a url match `/monolith/resources/card/dispute` , first modify the path to `/disputes` (because this is rest endpoint of the microservice) and then direct the traffic to the monolith, everything else should go to the monolith.

```yaml
type: TrafficRoute
name: kong-reroute
mesh: default
sources:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: kong
destinations:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: monolith-service_svc_5000
conf:
  http:
    - match:
        path:
          prefix: "/monolith/resources/card/dispute"
      modify:
        path:
          rewritePrefix: /disputes
      destination:
        kuma.io/service: microservice_microservice_svc_8080
  destination:
    kuma.io/service: monolith-service_svc_5000
```

Now when make the API call from Insomnia, we can see disputes are being returned with a 200 status code.

## Recap on the Migration

Through this tutorialized migration we wanted to demonstrate the power that Kong Mesh with its Universal Mode, multi-zone and multi-tenant capabilities can offer.

Essentially we what we did was created distributed mesh network that supported the monolith and microservices together, even though they were seperated by both cloud (on premise vs cloud) providers and runtimes (monolith vs kubernetes). When the cutover to the microservice was executed, it was centralized with kong mesh to manage.

We hope you have learned and are inspired to go forth with Kong Mesh.
